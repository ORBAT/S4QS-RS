# S4QS-RS
S4QS-RS reads S3 object creation events from SQS and copies data from S3 to Redshift using COPY with S3 manifests (see Redshift's [COPY](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_COPY.html)
documentation for more information.) Data is copied into time series tables with configurable rotation periods and retention, and a view with a configurable amount of time series tables is created.

View creation is done so that adding or removing columns from time series tables doesn't cause the view to break; missing spots are filled in with `NULL as [missing_col_name]` in the view's queries.

See the [S3 documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/UG/SettingBucketNotifications.html) for more information about setting up the object creation events. Note that if you publish the events to SNS and then subscribe your SQS queue to the SNS topic, you **must** set the "Raw Message Delivery" subscription attribute to "**True**".

## Installation

`npm install -g s4qs-rs`

## Configuration
S4QS-RS is configurable with JSON files located in either the `./config` subdirectory of the current working directory, or at `$NODE_CONFIG_DIR`. `./config/default.json` is always loaded and used for default settings, and `$NODE_ENV` is used to determine environment-specific configuration files: For example `NODE_ENV=production` would cause `./config/production.json` to be loaded.

`NODE_ENV`-specific configuration files will always override the default configuration. If `./config/default.json` is, for example

```json
  {
    "SQS": {
      "params": {
        "QueueUrl": "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/12345/prod-queue",
        "MaxNumberOfMessages": 10
      }
    },
    "S3Copier": {
      "other": "stuff here"
    }
  }
```

and `./config/development.json` is

```json
  {
    "SQS": {
      "params": {
        "QueueUrl": "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/12345/dev-queue"
      }
    }
  }
```

only `SQS.params.QueueUrl` would be overridden.

You can also use Javascript files as configuration files. See the [config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config) NPM package documentation for more information.

S4QS-RS defaults to `NODE_ENV=development` if `NODE_ENV` is omitted.

AWS credentials are loaded by the Node AWS SDK. See [the SDK's documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/node-configuring.html) for more information. S4QS-RS needs IAM permissions to perform `redshift:DescribeClusters`.

       the "table" property is used to build the "base" of the Redshift table name. table can be either a string
       like "my_table_name" or a regular expression (which must start and end with a /).
       The regular expression is given an S3 URI (s3://bucket-name/some/key), and the first capture group 
       will be used as the table name.

       When using a regex, periods in the S3 URI are converted to underscores but that's it.
       Feed it weird URIs and weird stuff will probably happen. You have been warned.

       The regex, tablePostfix and timeSeries settings in this example would turn URIs like
       s3://bucketname/whatevs/some.table.name/.*
       to time series tables that have names like "some_table_name_devel_ts_1428883200",
       and the rolling view would have the name "some_table_name_view_devel".

       If you use Javascript configuration files, you can specify a function
       for "table". The function must take an S3 URI and output a valid
       Redshift table name.

## Environment variables
S4QS-RS uses the [debug NPM package](npmjs.org/package/debug) for outputting debug messages to stdout and error messages to stderr. To see **any** error messages, you **must** run S4QS-RS with the env `DEBUG=s4qs-rs:*:error`. To see debug messages, run with `DEBUG=s4qs-rs:*` See debug's documentation for more information.

You can [map environment variables to configuration parameters](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Environment-Variables#custom-environment-variables) by creating a file with the name `./config/custom-environment-variables.json`. For example

```json
{
  "S3Copier": {
    "Redshift": {
      "connStr": "RS_CONN"
    }
  }
}
```

would map `$RS_CONN` to `S3Copier.Redshift.connStr`. Values set with environment variables always override configuration file values.

## Running S4QS-RS
After setting up your configuration, you can run S4QS-RS with `DEBUG=*:error s4qs-rs` or `DEBUG=sq4s-rs:* s4qs-rs` to see debugging information.

S4QS-RS traps `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` to make sure in-flight copies complete and the corresponding SQS messages and S3 manifests are deleted. This may take several minutes depending on what you're copying, so don't be alarmed if nothing seems to happen.

## Errata

If you `require('s4qs-rs')`, you can use the different components of S4QS-RS separately from the command line tool. See the source code for the documentation, plus have a look at [app.js](app.js).
