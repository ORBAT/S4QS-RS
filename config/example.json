       the "table" property is used to build the "base" of the Redshift table name. table can be either a string

       The regular expression is given an S3 URI (s3://bucket-name/some/key), and the first capture group
       will be used as the table name.

       When using a regex, periods in the S3 URI are converted to underscores but that's it as far as sanitization for
       Redshift goes.
       Feed it weird URIs and weird stuff will probably happen.

       The regex, tablePostfix and timeSeries settings in this example would turn URIs like
       s3://bucketname/whatevs/some.table.name/somefilename.csv.gz
       to time series tables that have names like "some_table_name_devel_ts_1428883200",
       and the rolling view would have the name "some_table_name_view_devel".

       If you use Javascript configuration files, you can specify a function
       for "table". The function must take an S3 URI and output a valid
       Redshift table name.
